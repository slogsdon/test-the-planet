# TestThePlanet

Code for an Elixir workshop covering testing with ExUnit.

The workshop is intended to be instructor led and doesn't seek out to cover the
merits of testing, TDD, etc. It is designed to walk a participant through what
tools ExUnit has to offer and effective ways to leverage those tools.

## Progression

A participant will want the ExUnit documentation available while using the
available code, documentation, and type specs available in this project's
modules. The below order is a suggestion but does not have to be taken.

1. `TestThePlanet.TheBasics`
2. `TestThePlanet.OutsideInfluence`
3. `TestThePlanet.ProvideContext`
